# Firebase App Hosting configuration note
#
# This project deploys on Firebase App Hosting (Node builder) with Next.js.
# The builder runs `npm ci` and `next build` using your package.json. If you
# want to speed up installs and avoid dev-only tooling in CI, this repo ships
# an `.npmrc` with `omit=dev`.
#
# Stack:
# - Hosting: Firebase App Hosting
# - Auth: Firebase Authentication + App Check (reCAPTCHA Enterprise)
# - Database: Firestore
# - Functions/Server: Next.js API Routes
